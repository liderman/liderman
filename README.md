### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Konstantin Osipov

I'm working as a Chief technical officer for Citilink.ru. Previously, I worked for a major social network and regional ISP as a Technical Lead, DevOps Engineer, or Software Engineer.

I'm interested in: high-load systems, automation, platformization, challenges, cool technologies and working with interesting people.
